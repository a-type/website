Rout! is the working name of a project I've been bootstrapping since 2024. I like to take my time with new ideas when I have the opportunity; both from product and technical perspectives I find new insights can come just by letting something stew for a while.

What I'll say about Rout!, for now, is it's borne out of a desire for connection with friends through play, inspired by board game nights and Jackbox games and Wordle.

Now that Rout! is finally starting to take shape as a product, I hope to start testing it publicly soon.
