title: 'Replacing the battery on Nest Outdoor Camera'
---

Since I haven't found any documentation on the internet to do this, I'll describe the process in my little corner of the web. Hope this gets indexed.

So the Nest Outdoor Camera doesn't have any visible external seams or screws. To get it open, you'll have to pry out the black facade from the white plastic housing. This will require a sturdy but _very_ thin spudger, or a very small flathead screwdriver. And caution.

There are four clamps that hold the facade in place. The facade is also split in two, with one opaque half and one very slightly translucent half. The translucent plastic is significantly softer. You'll likely damage the edges of the plastic a bit, but it's not such a big deal.

The only danger of damaging the functional components is a ribbon cable which is positioned at the top of the camera. Avoid jabbing anything sharp at the top. Focus on loosening and detaching the internal clamps at the marked positions. You'll hear a click as they disengage, and that portion of the facade should become looser and easier to pry out of the housing.
